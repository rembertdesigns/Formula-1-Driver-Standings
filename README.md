## 🏁 F1 API Integration

This app can be extended using real-time data from the [Ergast Developer API](https://ergast.com/mrd/), a public API for accessing current and historical Formula 1 data.

✅ Great next steps include:
- Integrating live standings, race results, and constructor data
- Visualizing season comparisons with driver telemetry
- Automating weekly updates via scheduled API calls
  
If you're a hiring manager or recruiter, this demonstrates real-world readiness for working with external APIs, async data handling, and dynamic rendering in production apps.
